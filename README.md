# ByteMe-Email
Email client (desktop application), that enables configuration and management of a GMAIL account

Project plan: 
 An application that is used to send and receive emails. The application will allow you to scan for unwanted, malicious  messages. Once a malicious message is deleted, the message will be redirected into a spam folder. We will test and confirm our results by sending a test message containing  malicious data and displaying how it gets detected then moved into spam folder. 
From the home screen a user will be able to view their messages and individually scan them for viruses, send messages, and lastly encrypt and decrypt messages. 
Another future goal is to allow the user to send a message encrypted in a photo (steganography).
